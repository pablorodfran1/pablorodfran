        <h6>07:11:2019</h6>
        <p>A boxed mix might seem like the easy way to make pancakes, but this triple-tested recipe by the Good Housekeeping Test Kitchen is equally as simple and even more delicious. Perfect for your family's Sunday breakfast or a 30-minute dinner (breakfast for dinner, anyone?), this best-ever recipe is a classic for a few reasons: It's quick, versatile, and best of all, a hit with kids and adults alike. Whether you're short on ingredients or still struggling with your flipping skills, check out these expert tips from Susan Westmoreland, culinary director, before you bust out your griddle.

What's the secret to the best-ever pancakes?

One word: buttermilk. "The acidity in the buttermilk makes the tenderest pancakes," Westmoreland says. "For best leavening results, reduce the baking powder in the recipe below to 2 teaspoons and add 1/2 teaspoon baking soda.

How do you make pancakes fluffy?

It's simple: Don't over mix the dry and wet ingredients. "First, put all your dry ingredients into a large bowl and whisk to incorporate the leavening(s) with the flour and sugar and get rid of any lumps," Westmoreland recommends. "In another bowl, whisk your wet ingredients so that the egg, milk, butter, and flavoring are completely blended. Once that's done, pour the wet ingredients in the bowl of dry ingredients and give it a few whisks, just until all the flour is moistened." There's no need to mix the batter until all lumps are gone because they'll dissolve naturally.

How do I make flat pancakes?

For thinner pancakes, add more milk to the batter little by little until you reach the desired consistency.

Can I make pancakes without eggs?

To make, simply increase the baking powder by 1/2 teaspoon and add up to 1/4 cup extra milk as needed to make a pourable batter.

Can I make pancakes without milk?

Actually, you can make pancakes with water, coffee, or juice (like OJ!) as the liquid. Use 1/4 cup less liquid to avoid a runny batter.

What can I add to pancakes?

For berry pancakes, add a cup of blueberries or strawberries to the batter. For banana pancakes, add a mashed ripe banana. For nutty pancakes, add 1/2 cup toasted, finely chopped pecans or walnuts. For a citrusy zest, add 1 teaspoon grated lemon or orange zest. For cream cheese pancakes, add 3 ounces of finely chopped cream cheese to the batter.

If you're looking for a healthier alternative, swap out half of the all-purpose flour for whole wheat or buckwheat.

What kind of pan should I use?

An electric griddle or stovetop is the best pan for making pancakes, so you’ll have have the best leverage for flipping them. If you don’t have a griddle, use a large skillet with sloping slides.</p>
